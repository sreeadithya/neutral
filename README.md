the first web app i've built fully using a js framework. was definitely challenging having a bunch of information coming at me all at once but i definitely had fun. built this using svelte and used firebase for auth and storing data. the desktop version was made using tauri.

for now i'm putting a soft pause on working on this but i'll most probably come back to make a few changes to the user interface to make it a tad bit better, or maybe not, who knows.

see ya!
