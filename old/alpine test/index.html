    welcome to <b>neutral.</b> the most lightweight and stripped down version of a todo list app you can find. <br><br>
    most todo apps have beautiful user interfaces and have a ton of features. i absolutely love that but i think it’s quite
    unproductive if a user gets distracted when they just want to come in, type what they need, look at their tasks and leave immediately.
    this is an app that i have built based on my specific requirements and nothing more. i feel this is perfectly geared towards students
    and power users that just want to get things done very efficiently without having to setup much. <br><br>
    designed with keyboard usage in mind so you’ll basically never have to touch the mouse and has a very low-key yet tasteful user interface.
